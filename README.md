# Filebucket Server
<!-- * A short description of your application -->
Filebucket is a Dropbox-like app that allows users to upload files into a
virtual file system. Anyone can read or dowload files and owners can delete
or rename their own files. Filebucket stores information for the files on a
MongooseDB database and stores the files in and AWS S3 bucket. The client is
built using Bootstrap and Handlebars
